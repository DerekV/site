# Me

I'm a professional software developer and general enthusiast.

I consider myself a "full stack" developer, in that I try to dabble in all aspects software creation to some degree or another.

Currently working at (MadDog Technology)[http://maddogtechnology.com], living in Michigan, Detroit area.

# This

It's a repository for my personal self expression into the world internet community. Some people have had similar sites, and called them a "blog", but "blog" to me sounds a lot like a B-class comic book super-villain.
