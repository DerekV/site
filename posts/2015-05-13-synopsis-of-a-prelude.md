# What are we doing here?

Sometimes, I like to walk and try not to think about where I am going.  Exploring, I guess.  Eventually I get to a place, and I stand, wait, breath, and just experience being there.  I do not try to make the place be anything, I don't ask anything out of it.

I'm not sure what this site will become.  Right now, I just have a notion that I want to have a site to publicly post ideas.  Well, the internet is as good a place as any to start, I suppose.  The weather is cool and overcast, there is a breeze, it perfect weather for this type of exploring.  I guess I'll start walking, and let this site become.
